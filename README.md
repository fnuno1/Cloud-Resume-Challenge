# 🌐 Cloud Resume Challenge — Fabian Nuno

![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Actions-ready-blue?logo=githubactions)

This is my personal resume website built as part of the **Cloud Resume Challenge**.  
It showcases my front-end development skills, certifications, and cloud readiness.  
Backend, CI/CD, and Azure integrations will be added in the next phase.

## 📊 Visitor Counter (Coming Soon)

This project includes a placeholder for a dynamic visitor counter.  
The final implementation will use:

- Azure Functions (JavaScript or Python)
- Azure Cosmos DB or Table Storage
- A secure API endpoint
- JavaScript fetch call to update the counter in real time

Once deployed, the counter will automatically update on each page load.

## 📄 Project Overview

This resume site is built using:

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and layout  
- **Google Fonts** for clean typography  
- **Local images** for icons and certification badges  
- **GitHub** for version control and hosting  

The design uses a dark theme, responsive layout, hover effects, and clean typography to create a professional and modern resume experience.
