# Cloud Resume Challenge

This project is my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge — a hands-on, end‑to‑end cloud project designed to demonstrate real-world skills in web development, cloud infrastructure, automation, and CI/CD.

## 📄 Project Overview
This resume website is built using:

- **Images** and assets stored locally  

The site is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to update as my skills grow.

## 🚀 Features
- Fully responsive resume website  
- Clean, modern layout  
- Organized file structure for easy maintenance  
- Version-controlled through GitHub
